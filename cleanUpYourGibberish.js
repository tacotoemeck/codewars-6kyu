// We've begun receiving transmissions from Planet Gibber again after many decades of silence. Unfortunately, this time they've been all garbled up!

// Luckily, linguists were able to figure out the rules of Gibberish the last time we heard from them. They've given us a guide on how to identify the actual bits of language from the random data in the strings we receive.

// In order to parse the Gibberish from the... well, gibberish, we'll need to follow these rules:

// Gibberish, as we read it, only contains letters: remove all non-letter characters (including spaces)
// Gibberish is only made up of 5 letter words: separate this into words that are all 5 letters long - no trailing words with fewer than 5 letters!
// Gibberish word are all capitalised: so capitalise all the words (sort of like German nouns)
// Some of the transmissions are only garbled data. If you are given an empty string or a string that doesn't contain any letters, then please return an empty string at the end.

// Even if you can't read the Gibberish, that's okay as long as you've formatted it according to the language rules!

// Good luck :)
